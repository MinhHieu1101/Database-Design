Computing Technology Design Project (COS20031)

Swinburne University of Technology (Vietnam)

â–ª Database Design

To provide a dynamic, user-friendly database system that enables the smooth hiring platform for candidates and employers on the new Greeliving Learning Hub website.

This goal is clear, quantifiable, doable, pertinent, and time-bound. It also fits with the issue that the current website lacks a database management system and backend system, as is stated on the Project Plan page.

The following criteria should be taken into account when designing this database system:

* It should be able to manage and retain a wide range of data, such as learner data, training plans, candidate profiles, and job advertisements.

* It must to be simple for many users to use and update.

* It can also provide individuals with various training programs.
